# A3: Research project

Description

    Group activity, groups of two or three members
        Create the group in Moodle
        The group may be different from the ones for A1 and/or A2
    Select a research question that can be answered with the information available in MIMIC-III
    Add a short description of the selected mini-project to Moodle
    Develop the mini-project
    Submit the mini-project to the corresponding Moodle task. It must include:
        A document, in the form of a research paper: title, authors, abstract, non-scientific abstract (how would you explain your project to a teenager?), introduction, results, discussion, methods, and references. The document can be in any format, just choose the one you like more (Nature, Cell, Lancet, PNAS, etc.). It is mandatory that references are numbered and sorted in order of appearance
        Source code, notebooks, scripts, etc., either as Appendix or Supplementary Material, properly commented
        Slides of the presentation
        Results files (if any)
    Presentation of the mini-project in front of the professors and the rest of the class

 

Tools

    If the document is done in LaTeX, we recommend using Overleaf
    For managing references, it could be helpful to use Mendeley (there is URV Campus License, check in URV Intranet) or Zotero. Both have plugins for web browsers and Word
